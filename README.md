# Second Brain

A self-hosted productivity system that captures thoughts from Slack, categorizes them with AI, and stores them in Notion databases.

## Features

- **Capture**: Listen for messages in `#secondbrain` Slack channel
- **Categorize**: Claude Haiku classifies into people/projects/ideas/admin (confidence > 0.6)
- **Store**: Create entries in appropriate Notion database + Inbox Log audit trail
- **Correct**: Handle "fix:" and "update:" replies to re-categorize or change status
- **Digest**: Daily (5am) and weekly (Sunday 5pm) summaries with Google Tasks integration
- **Deliver**: Post to Slack channels AND create Google Task events

## Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Second Brain capture service
npm run brain

# Run calendar sync (specify days ahead to sync)
npm run sync -- 1    # sync 1 day ahead
npm run sync -- 4    # sync 4 days (weekend coverage)
npm run sync -- 7    # sync a full week

# Run digests manually for testing
npm run daily
npm run weekly
```

## Systemd Service (Raspberry Pi)

```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp secondbrain.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Enable and start
sudo systemctl enable secondbrain
sudo systemctl start secondbrain

# View logs
journalctl -u secondbrain -f

# Restart after changes
sudo systemctl restart secondbrain
```

## Usage

### Capturing Items

Send a message to `#secondbrain`:
```
Met with Sarah from marketing, she mentioned the Q2 budget review is coming up
```

The bot will:
1. Categorize it (e.g., "people")
2. Extract relevant fields (name, context, follow-ups)
3. Create a Notion entry
4. Reply with confirmation

### Correcting Classifications

Reply to any captured message with:
- `fix: projects` - re-categorize to a different destination
- `update: done` - change the status

### Prefixes for Better Accuracy

For clearer classification, use prefixes:
- `person: ...` for people
- `project: ...` for projects
- `idea: ...` for ideas
- `admin: ...` for tasks/errands

## Google Tasks Integration

The digest system integrates with Google Tasks to provide better context:

### Daily Digest
- Shows existing incomplete tasks to avoid duplicate suggestions
- Shows recently completed tasks so the AI doesn't re-suggest finished work
- Creates Google Tasks for the Top 3 Actions

### Weekly Digest
- Includes completed tasks in the "What Moved Forward" analysis
- Cleans up completed tasks older than 7 days after digest runs

### Task Lifecycle
1. Daily digest generates Top 3 Actions and creates Google Tasks
2. User completes tasks in Google Tasks throughout the week
3. Weekly digest sees completed tasks for progress tracking
4. Old completed tasks (>7 days) are cleaned up after weekly digest
